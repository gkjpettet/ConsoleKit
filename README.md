# ConsoleKit
A module containing useful features for console-based apps

## What is it?
`ConsoleKit` is a module that includes all of the functionality that I seem to need on most console applications I create with Xojo. I decided to bundle them up into a module for convenience.

## Current features
- Handling of command line arguments via the `OptionParser` and related classes
- ANSI text formatting to print coloured, bold and underlined text to the command line
